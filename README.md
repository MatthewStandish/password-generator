# <Password-generator>

## Description

- This project was built in order to generate a password which contains a series of promts to be answered and given a secure password.
- This purpose of this project is to allow for a secure resource for protected passwords.
- During this project, I solved many problems in JavaScript and it has given me knowledge about how to complete technical projects in the future.
